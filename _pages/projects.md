## Water-related Land Cover Dynamics in Northeast Asia Under Climate Change and Anthropogenic Activities

**08/2021-present**

**Advisor**: _Prof. [Xiangming Xiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=71350TcAAAAJ&hl=en)_

- The **overall aim** is to enhance our understanding of the impacts of changing climate and increasing human activities on the dynamics of water-related land cover types.
 - We have developed a set of knowledge-based water-related land cover (yearlong surface water, paddy rice, natural wetlands) mapping algorithms by integrating multi-source (optical, SAR, thermal) remote sensing.
 - We consider the remote sensing capability and define water-related land cover  types in terms of plant growth form (tree, shrub, grass), life cycle (perennial, annual), leaf seasonality (evergreen, deciduous), and canopy type (open, closed).
 - We have constructed a water/non-water database to study the surface and terrestrial water resources dynamics in Northeast Asia during 2000-2023. We have explored the impacts of climate and anthropogenic factors on water resources, and the pressures of water resource changes on populations.
