## Water-related Land Cover Dynamics in Northeast Asia Under Climate Change and Anthropogenic Activities

**08/2021-present**

**Advisor**: _Prof. [Xiangming Xiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=71350TcAAAAJ&hl=en)_

- The **overall aim** is to enhance our understanding of the impacts of changing climate and increasing human activities on the dynamics of water-related land cover types.
 - Water related land cover types include yearlong surface water, paddy rice, and natural wetlands.
 - We have developed a set of knowledge-based water-related land cover mapping algorithms based on each type's unique and stable optical and/or microwave signatures (associated with its biophysical features), by integrating multi-source (optical, SAR, thermal) remote sensing.
 - We consider the remote sensing capability and define water-related land cover  types in terms of plant growth form (tree, shrub, grass), life cycle (perennial, annual), leaf seasonality (evergreen, deciduous), and canopy type (open, closed).
 - We developed algorithms to detect the duration of surface water disappearance under extreme drought.
 - We have constructed a water/non-water database to study the surface and terrestrial water resources dynamics in Northeast Asia during 2000-2023. We have explored the impacts of climate and anthropogenic factors on water resources, and the pressures of water resource changes on populations.

## Characterizing Urban Growth in Small and Medium-sized Cities

**06/2020-07/2021**

**Advisor**: _Prof. [Chong Huang](https://igsnrr.cas.cn/sourcedb/zw/zjrck/kygg/xxxt/201404/t20140411_4088717.html)_

- While annual urban growth rates are declining in many highly urbanized regions of the world, Southeast Asia (SEA) is experiencing an accelerated urbanization process in small and medium-sized cities (SMCs), to which little attention has been paid.
- Accurately extracting urban land information for SMCs in SEA has remained challenging, considering the lower urban land density, higher vegetation cover, and complex landscape mosaic.
- This study systematically analyzed the capacities of a set of statistical indicators (SWIR1, SWIR2, NDVI, VV, and VH) of time-series optical and SAR images in impervious surface extraction.
- Temporal rate of urban expansion,  urban land density variation, and sptial expansion patterns were analyzed.
