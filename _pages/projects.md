* I served as a Student/Early Career Convener and Outstanding Student Presentation Awards (OSPA) Liaisons for the AGU 2023 Fall Meeting session “Advances in land cover and land use changes: data products, driving factors, and impacts”.

1. Define and divide wetlands into subcategories in terms of vegetation types (grass, shrub, and tree), leaf trait (evergreen, deciduous, and annual), and canopy structure (open canopy and closed canopy)
2. Develop mapping algorithms to identify each wetland categories integrating images from multiply satellites.
3. Will study inter-annual spatial-temporal changes of surface water bodies and wetlands in Northern Eurasia during 2015-2024.
4. Will assess the climatic and anthropogenic driving factors of surface water bodies and wetlands dynamics.
Surface water bodies changes in Eurasia under extreme drought in 2022       Sept.2022-Present
1. Develop algorithms to detect the duration of surface water disappearance under extreme drought.
2. Generate the information about the start time, end time, and duration of surface disappearance.
3. Analyze the spatial and temporal change of water disappearance in 2022.
Detection of Planting Distribution and Change of Rubber Plantation in Northeast Thailand Based on High Spatial and Temporal Resolution Series Remote Sensing   Oct.2018-Jun.2020
1. Generate forest/non-forest map of northeast Thailand using 10m Sentinel-1 SAR data based on GEE platform.
2. Define the appropriate window sizes for each individual texture feature of different spatial resolutions data when distinguishing rubber plantation from natural forest.
3. Detect the planting year and pre-conversion land cover types of rubber plantation in northeastern Thailand.

1. Conduct the field survey of land cover in southeast Asia region. 
2. Extract land cover information of Indochina Peninsula and its coastal zone in 2020 and 1990. 
3. Quantify and analyze the land cover change in Indochina Peninsula between 1990 and 2020.

1. Analyze the temporal and spatial response of groundwater depth to hydrometeorological factors (including precipitation, evaporation and runoff).
2. Explore the effects of geographical conditions (including landforms, soil texture and soil types) on the relationship between precipitation and groundwater using Geographical Detectors.
